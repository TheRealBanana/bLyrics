# bLyrics 2.0

# Whats this?
Basically all this does is show lyrics for the currently playing song in Foobar2000. It also makes use the ajquery web interface template to allow interaction with the player (play, stop, skip, etc) through the GUI as well. Downloaded lyrics are cached locally and can be edited through the main GUI (edit button at the bottom left of the lyrics tab).
